# Math of Cryptology
Here we implement some useful math algorithms based on `num::bigint`. You may find some of them has been implemented by the crates.

What we implement are:
- GCD
- EX_GCD, which mainly used to calculate inv number under a mod.
- CRT
- Fast Pow
- Miller-Rabin Test
  
Now we still do not implement Miller-Rabin test. We will implement it soon.
